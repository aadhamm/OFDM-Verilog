The RAMB36E1 OFDM_Transmitter1/u_whdlOFDMTx_Model/u_Frame_Formation_and_OFDM_Modulation/u_Dual_Rate_RAM/ram_reg_0 has an input control pin OFDM_Transmitter1/u_whdlOFDMTx_Model/u_Frame_Formation_and_OFDM_Modulation/u_Dual_Rate_RAM/ram_reg_0/ADDRARDADDR[10] (net: OFDM_Transmitter1/u_whdlOFDMTx_Model/u_Frame_Formation_and_OFDM_Modulation/u_Dual_Rate_RAM/ADDRARDADDR[7]) which is driven by a register (OFDM_Transmitter1/u_whdlOFDMTx_Model/u_Frame_Formation_and_OFDM_Modulation/u_Generate_RAM_Inputs/Delay1_out1_reg) that has an active asychronous set or reset. This may cause corruption of the memory contents and/or read values when the set/reset is asserted and is not analyzed by the default static timing analysis.
